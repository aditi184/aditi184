Hi! I'm Aditi, a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at McGill University and MILA – Quebec AI Institute, advised by Prof. Siva Reddy and Prof. Golnoosh Farnadi.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent two years at Microsoft in the Turing Team, working with Prof. Monojit Choudhury on human-values alignment, ethical reasoning, value pluralism and foreign language effect in large language models (LLMs). I also contributed to building Bing Copilot Chat, focusing on conversation quality evaluations, developing and training next user message suggestions models, and worked on training of the state-of-the-art Visual Document Understanding model at Microsoft Turing. Before joining Microsoft, I completed my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.

My research interests lie in making language technologies more representative and adaptive to the complex interplay of languages and cultures. I aim to develop inclusive AI systems that equitably serve diverse global populations. I am also interested in plurastic human values alignment in LLMs. Additionally, I am passionate about expanding the general capabilities of language and multimodal models.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
